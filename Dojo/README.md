# GOALLLL

Until I lure someone to implement node.js version and put it on npm for profit.

# Explanation

There are two csv files:

* trainingsample.csv
* validationsample.csv

Format is:

* First row is header.
* Given a data row (not header),
    * First column is number that the image is representing.
    * The rest of columns are pixels of the image.

For each image (row) in `validationsample.csv`, find the best matching image in `trainingsample.csv`.
And compare the number (first column).

For example, 5th image of `validationsample.csv` is 3. And if you found the best matching image from `trainingsample.csv`, 
its label should be 3.

Correct answer should be `94.4%`. There are 500 images in `validationsample.csv`. 472 of them are _correctly_ matched against 5000 images in `trainingsample.csv`.

# Summary


- C fast.
- Python slow.
- Go and Rust similar.
- But it's all meaningless because node.js will beat them all once written utilizing mongodb webscale power.

# pseudo code

    validationsample.csv = parsed from file
    trainingsample.csv = parsed from file

    t = now()
    good_match_count = 0
    for unknown in validationsample.csv:
        match = null
        min_distance = MAX_DISTANCE
        for known in trainingsample.csv:
            d = distance(unknown, known)
            if d < min_distance:
                min_distance = d
                match = known
        if match.label == unknown.label:
            good_match_count++

    print(good_match_count/validationsample.csv.length)
    print(now() - t)


    function distance(pixels1, pixels2):
        result = 0
        for i in 0 to pixels1.length:
            d = pixels1[i]-pixels2[i]
            result += d*d
        return result
